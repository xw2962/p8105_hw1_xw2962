## Problem 1 

#### Load the moderndive library
```{r setup}
library(tidyverse)
library(moderndive)
```

#### Load the early_january_weather dataset
```{r dataset_load}
data("early_january_weather")
```

#### Short Description of the Dataset

This dataset has 15 variables: `r colnames(early_january_weather)`

There are `r nrow(early_january_weather)` rows. And there are `r ncol(early_january_weather)` columns. 

The mean of the temperature is `r mean(early_january_weather$temp)`

#### Making a scatterplot
```{r scatterplot}
time_hour=early_january_weather$time_hour
temp=early_january_weather$temp
ggplot(early_january_weather, aes(x = time_hour, y = temp,color=humid)) + geom_point()
ggsave("scatter_plot_hw1_q1.pdf",height=4,width=4)
```

#### Describe patterns that are apparent in this plot
The temp increases with the increasing time_hour. And humid increases with increasing temp.
